# botw-hyrule-compendium

Hey there! The botw-hyrule-compendium is a fun project where I can learn English terms from the continent of Hyrule while playing around with Node.js 20, React 18, and Next.js 13. It's like a mock version of [Guide of the Wild](https://www.guideofthewild.com/) and uses the awesome database from the [Hyrule Compendium API](https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/).
