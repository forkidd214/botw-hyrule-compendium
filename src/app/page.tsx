        This noble creature watches over all animals that make their homes in
        the forest. Legends say this holy creature is a reincarnation of a sage
        that died on the lands it now protects. It has an acute awareness of its
        surroundings, so it seldom appears before people. It&apos;s sometimes
        known by its other name, Satori.
